# fbSearch

Facebook pages are used by businesses, organisations and brands to share their stories and

connect with users.

Your assignment is to create a HTML page that facilitates searching for these &quot;pages&quot;, using

only JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

To your help you have Facebook&#39;s public API for searching pages, documented here:

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/

Most of the APIs that deal with searching and reading &quot;pages&quot; do not require user

authorisation, and they support JSONP (through the &quot;callback&quot; parameter).

Requirements:

 Use only the javascript capabilities available to you in the browser, no external

libraries.

 For each search result, make it possible for the user to find out more about the page,

for example by expanding an individual result. Make sure that the search results are

displayed in descending order. (Use your own custom sort to display the results)

 You need not worry about old web browsers.

 No &quot;server side&quot; code.

 The user should be able to &quot;favourite&quot; and &quot;unfavorite&quot; pages (making his/hers

favourites easily accessible)

 No frames or iframes

Look and feel is always important, but the main focus is the code!

Once you feel ready to submit your code and make it available as a download!
